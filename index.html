Open the Google Developer Tools. Click on the "Elements" tab. Here we have the DOM representation of the HTML source the browser loaded. Use the "Elements" window to see that the body node is, temporarily, child-less.

<h1>My HTML adventure</h1>
Refresh the page and view the Elements tab again. You should see that a new child-node has appeared underneath body. You can use the disclosure triangle to see which children are wrapped or nested within the body tag.

Next, we'll add a paragraph below the title. We'll also add some highlighted bits of text to the paragraph to make it stand out a little.

  We're basically telling computers what to do. <em>Neat!</em>
